You need to create automation tests for Twitter public API.

Check basic operations:

1. GET
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/home_timeline
Fields to verify
- created_at
- retweet_count
- text

2. POST
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/destroy/id
- Verify that status was really removed

3. POST
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/statuses/update
Fields to verify
- text (check that text can be updated)
Additional:
- Check that tweet duplication causes 403 error

4. Create functional tests based on API tests which will verify corresponding Twitter Web UI.
Tests should be written using Java + Selenium WebDriver


//able to run on multiple environments
//better ui tests architecture
